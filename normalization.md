# Airbnb Database Normalization (Up to 3NF)
# First Normal Form (1NF)
- Each attribute contains atomic (indivisible) values.
- Each record is unique, identified by a primary key.

 All tables (`User`, `Property`, `Booking`, `Payment`, `Review`, `Message`) are in 1NF.

# Second Normal Form (2NF)
- The database is already in 1NF.
- All non-key attributes depend on the entire primary key.

Each table has a single-column primary key (UUID), so no partial dependency exists.
# Third Normal Form (3NF)
- The database is already in 2NF.
- No transitive dependency (non-key attributes only depend on the primary key).

All tables meet 3NF:
| Table | Primary Key | Dependency | 
|--------|--------------|-----------------------|
| User | user_id | All fields depend on user_id |
| Property | property_id | All fields depend on property_id |
| Booking | booking_id | All fields depend on booking_id |
| Payment | payment_id | All fields depend on payment_id 
| Review | review_id | All fields depend on review_id 
| Message | message_id | All fields depend on message_id |

**Conclusion:**  
The Airbnb database design satisfies **Third Normal Form (3NF)** â€” ensuring no redundancy and improved data integrity.
